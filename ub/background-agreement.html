<h1>untitled-bot background agreement</h1>
<p>
1. The content I upload is mine or content I have the right to.<br>
2. The content I upload is not explicit.<br>
3. The content I upload may be viewed by the owner of the bot along with my Discord ID to prevent abuse.<br>
4. The content I upload will be removed from the bot and I understand I will not be allowed to use this bot if I break this agreement.<br><br><br><br>
(I know you're thinking <i>Seriously, do I REALLY have to do this?</i> and yes.  I need to make sure that my bot is protected and that the users using it aren't using it maliciously).<br>
