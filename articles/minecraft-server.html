<h1>How to setup a Minecraft server for free on dedicated hardware.</h1>

<h2>This is assuming you already have a Linux server up and running.</h2>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>At least 4GB of memory dedicated to the server, or 10GB for large servers.</li>
    <li>At least 3GB of storage dedicated to the server, or 50GB for large servers.</li>
    <li>A network connection with a ping of less than 100ms to <a href="https://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> and fast-ish speeds.</li>
    <li>Access to the server via SSH and FTP (or any protocol that transfers files).</li>
    <li>Any Linux distro that you can easily install Java 11 on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>Make sure you have OpenJDK 11 installed, you can use anything that's Java 8+, but OpenJDK seems to be faster.<br>
For this tutorial, I recommend using Paper's server software rather than Mojang's default one, as it is much faster
and can handle plugins.<br><br>
You can download Paper <a href="https://papermc.io/download">here</a>, or Mojang's server <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server">here</a>.<br>
You can create a virtual environment to run the server in for better security if you're installing plugins, but you don't need it otherwise.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Running the software</h2>
<p>After the software is downloaded into it's own directory (e.g. /home/minecraft/server/), go into the directory and type 
<code>java -jar server.jar</code> (or whatever the name is), when it closes, <i>"read the server software eula in eula.txt"</i> and agree to it,
then run it again.  Besides port forwarding port 25565 (tcp and udp), the server is all setup!!  you can download plugins for servers from
<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/?order=download_count">Spigot MC</a> and
<a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins?filter-game-version=&filter-sort=4">Bukkit</a>, both will work for paper, just make sure that
the Minecraft version listed for the server matches the version you're running, otherwise it could cause some compatibility issues and long stack traces
in the terminal ;-;<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Installing plugins</h2>
<p>Want plugins?  It's super simple.  All you need to do is send the jar to the path of the minecraft server in the plugins directory, something like
<code>/home/minecraft/server/plugins/</code>, then just restart the server!</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>There is a page on optimizing Minecraft server stuff <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/">here</a>
that fits most users needs.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>WARNINGS!!!</h2>
<p>Do NOT name the startup script for the server start.sh, it will 100% cause issues.  Name it server.sh or something instead.</p>
